				<p class="paragraph-light">
				
					Creating a large modpack is already proved to be a very hard feat to accomplish. 
					One may experience many tough challenges, such as the numerous amount of crash reports 
					you would receive, the hundreds of glitches you will encounter, and the lag you may 
					receive. However, one person PulseBeat_02, with another developer BomberCost, has decided 
					to start building to this dream. Today, we present to you “King Mammoth”, the world’s 
					largest modpack inspired by other famous modpacks out there.
					
					<br /><br />
					
					You may ask, how did you make this modpack run so fast? How did you make such a large 
					modpack that doesn’t crash? These questions are still not yet answerable by the King Mammoth Team.
					Although we have not found an answer to these questions, we have strived and pushed our limits to 
					optimize this modpack as far as we can, whether it is from using the complex mechanics of Java to 
					manipulate the memory use, to just removing unnecessary mods from the modpack.
					
					<br /> <br />
					
					Around 2018 and 2019, we released our first copy of the modpack. It was very buggy and proved to 
					not be a success. Many complained from the unbearable lag they would receive in their clients, the 
					chunk corruptions in their single-player worlds, and so much more. We decided to address these problems 
					immediately and improve our modpack for future updates. Today, King Mammoth is a thriving community 
					with a large number of members in the discord. 
					
					<br /> <br />
					
					We have almost hit 1000 downloads, and we hope that the community will grow larger as time passes. 
					
					<br /> <br />
					
					- PulseBeat_02, Founder of King Mammoth.
